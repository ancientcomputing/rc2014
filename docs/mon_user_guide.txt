Introduction

The Monitor/Debugger for the RC2014 is a "machine language" monitor that is very similar
in functionality to those shipped with the original microcomputers of the late 1970s to
early 1980s. This with the exception that user interaction is with a serial terminal as
opposed to a bunch of switches and LED hexadecimal displays as with the earliest 
microcomputers.

A Monitor/Debugger allows users to type in programs that they have assembled into machine
code: the actual instructions that microprocessors recognize. It also allows users to
examine and modify memory, execute programs, and set breakpoints and view registers when 
breakpoints are hit.

Many early microcomputers only came with a Monitor/Debugger. Advanced languages like BASIC
were only available as an upgrade. Later home computers dispensed with the Monitor/
Debugger and only shipped with a version of BASIC or even FORTH!

The Monitor/Debugger for the RC2014 was written for folks developing Z80 assembly code
and wanting to load, run and debug their programs on the RC2014.


Installation

The Monitor/Debugger binary is less than 4KB in size. It can be burned into a 27C512 
EPROM that is similar to the one that comes with the RC2014. You can also burn it into a
28C256 if you know how to configure the RC2014 e.g. connecting Jumper 4 on the RC2014 
Mini to Vcc.

The Monitor/Debugger binary filename is "mon.rom" and is found here:
https://github.com/ancientcomputing/rc2014/tree/master/rom


Boot

Boot the RC2014 normally e.g. connect the serial line to a computer running a terminal
emulator or an actual serial terminal, connect the power if applicable, then press and 
release the reset button.

You will see the following:
  RC2014
  Monitor >

The second line is the monitor's command line prompt.

If you press the reset button again, you will see
  RC2014
  C/W?

Press C for cold boot or W for warm boot.

Press W if you want to look at saved breakpoint registers. 


Monitor Commands

When presented with the monitor's command line prompt, you can press a key (on the 
terminal or terminal emulator) to enter a command.

Valid monitor commands are:
?              Print this help
A XXXX         Disassemble from XXXX
C              Continue from Breakpoint
D XXXX         Dump memory from XXXX
E XXXX         Edit memory from XXXX
G XXXX         Go execute from XXXX
H XXXX         Set HEX file start address to XXXX
I XX           Input from port XX
O XX YY        Output YY to port XX
R              Display registers from Breakpoint
:sHLtD...C     Load Intel HEX file, ':' is part of file

Pressing '?' will print the list of valid commands.


Running a program on the RC2014

Let's look at how you can load and execute programs on the RC2014 using the 
Monitor/Debugger.

Most Z80 assemblers or cross-assemblers will generate an Intel HEX file. This file
contains the executable Z80 machine code, but in a human readable format. Although you
will be hardpressed to understand any of it!

To run your new program on the RC2014, you will need to load the code into the RC2014 RAM.

Let's assume that you've written the following little program:

        .ORG 0C000H
        LD      HL, 0
START:
        LD      A, 0AH
        RST     08H
        LD      A, 0Dh
        RST     08H
        LD      A, 'A'
LOOP1:
        RST     08H
        INC     A
        CP      A, 'Z'+1
        JR      NZ, LOOP1
        JP      START

This little program will print the characters A to Z horizontally, then start all over 
again on a new line.

To make this program understandable by a Z80 processor, you will need to assemble it to
generate machine code.

I use the zasm cross-assembler for this. You may use other assemblers.

With zasm, you would type in the following command:
        zasm -u -x test.asm
        
Where test.asm is the text file that contains this little program.

zasm will produce a file called test.hex. If you open this file with a text editor, you 
will see the following contents:

        :170000002100003E0ACF3E0DCF015A5A3E41CF3CFE5B20FAC303C05F
        :00000001FF
        
The leading ':' symbols at the beginning of each line indicates that this is an Intel
HEX file.

The Monitor/Debugger is able to automatically understand that a ':' command means that 
the next set of data that comes over the serial console is the rest of the Intel HEX 
file.

You can either copy the file from the test editor and then paste it onto the terminal
emulator or use, if available, the built-in functions of your terminal emulator to send 
the Intel HEX file over.

For example, I use the Serial terminal emulator on a Mac. This program has a "Send Text
File" feature (Command-T). When I hit Command-T, it will ask me to choose a file to send
over to the RC2014 over the serial port.


HEX File Start Address

Before we send over the Intel HEx file, we need to understand the assembler that 
we're using and how it generates an Intel HEX file.

This is because, when you write a Z80 program, you need to specify where in the memory
space the program will reside and run. Unlike recent microprocessors, Z80 code is not
location independent without a lot of work. Immediate jump instructions, for example, 
may use absolute addresses.

In our little test program, we used the ".ORG 0C000H" command. This means that we have
assembled the code to run from memory location 0C00H (in hexadecimal values).

Unfortunately, zasm doesn't include this information in the Intel HEX file. So if you 
were to load test.hex, it will end up being written to location 0000H. This of course 
does not do anything since the Monitor/Debugger ROM resides in ROM in that location.

So before loading the test.hex file, you need to run the following command:
        h c000

Just press 'h' followed by 'c000' and ENTER.

What this does is to set the load address of the Intel HEX file data at memory location
0C000h which is where the test program need to be located in order to execute correctly.


Sending an Intel HEX file to the RC2014

Once you have set up the 'H' parameter, it is time to send the Intel HEX file to the 
RC2014.

Again, you can copy contents of the file, then paste it onto the terminal emulator
console at the Monitor > prompt.

You will get the following:

Monitor >:.
HEX TRANSFER COMPLETE ERRORS=00 0017 BYTES TRANSFERRED

The '.' is a tick mark and indicates that there was one line of actual data. The result
also indicates that there was no error and that 17H bytes (number again in hexadecimal)
was transferred.


Execute Your Program!

Now that you have successfully transferred the program to the RC2014, let's run it!

To run the program, type the following at the Monitor prompt:
        g c000<ENTER>

What do you see?

Since we did not include any checks in the program, the only way to halt it is to reset
the RC2014.

Once you hit reset, you will be prompted with:
        C/W?

Hit 'W' for warm start.


Exploring Memory Contents

Now, you may want to double check the contents of the test program at memory location
C000H.

To do this, hit 'D' at the command prompt, followed by the memory address and ENTER:
        d c000<ENTER>

This will give you the following output:

        C000  21 00 00 3E 0A CF 3E 0D CF 01 5A 5A 3E 41 CF 3C ; !..>..>...ZZ>A.<

        Press any key to continue, ESC to abort

As you can see the first byte of the "LD HL,0" instruction is at location C000H.

At this point, you can press any key to see memory at C100H onwards.

Alternatively, you can press ESC to go back to the Monitor prompt.


Examining and Changing Memory

What if you want to change your program without reassembling it and reloading the
Intel HEX file?

For example, in the test program, I want to start the print out with '0' instead of 'A'.

The instruction that loads the A register with 'A' is located at memory location C00CH.
This can be seen from the test.lst file that is generated when you run zasm.

At the Monitor prompt, hit E followed by c000 and ENTER:
        e c000<ENTER> 

You will see:
        C00C : 3E

Where 3E is the LD A instruction. Press 3E to enter the same value. You will see:
        C00C : 3E 3e 3E

Where the second 3e is what you typed and the third 3E is a confirmation that the value
was written to memory and successfully read back.

You will then see the content on the next memory location:
        C00D : 41

Now, 41 is the hexadecimal value for 'A'. To insert '0' instead, type 30 which is the
hexadecimal value for '0'. Thus:
        C00D : 41 30 30

Now run the program again with g c000. What do you see?


Inline Disassembler

To double check that you made the right change, the Monitor/Debugger includes an inline
disassembler.

At the Monitor prompt, press 'A' followed by c00c and ENTER. Thus:
        a c00c<ENTER>

You will see the following:

        Disassemble from C00C
        Press any key to step, ESC to abort
        C00C 3E 30       LD   A,30H

As you can see, 30H is the new value being loaded into the A register.

If you were to press any key (other than ESC), the disassembler will disassemble the next
instruction. Hence:
        C00E CF          RST  8 

This is the system call to print a character on the screen. Continue press any key to
look at the other instructions of the test program.

Then press ESC to return to the Monitor prompt.


Breakpoints

Breakpoints are places in your program where you pause the program execution. Generally
you want to use a breakpoint to understand the state of the Z80 registers and memory 
contents at a given point in your program. This is very useful for debugging and for 
learning the effect of using certain Z80 instructions that you are unfamiliar with.

To set a breakpoint, all you need to do is to insert the 'RST 30H' instruction where you
want your program to pause.

Let's insert a breakpoint just before the conditional jump instruction. The test program
will now look like:

        .ORG 0C000H
        LD      HL, 0
START:
        LD      A, 0AH
        RST     08H
        LD      A, 0Dh
        RST     08H
        LD      A, 'A'
LOOP1:
        RST     08H
        INC     A
        CP      A, 'Z'+1
        RST     30H
        JR      NZ, LOOP1
        JP      START

Now assemble the program and load the resulting Intel HEX file to the RC2014. Then use 
G command to run the program.

You will see the following:
        A
        Breakpoint at PC=C012
        AF =429B  BC =5A5A  DE =C000  HL =0000  
        AF'=4D09  BC'=FFFF  DE'=FF03  HL'=4D09  
        IX =0018  IY =0000  IR =007F  SP =81FF  
        Press C to continue or ESC to return to Monitor

The first line you see is the output of your program, when it prints the letter 'A'.

Then you see the breakpoint message, telling you that the breakpoint occurred when the 
Z80 was executing the instruction at 0C012H. This is the location where the breakpoint
instruction (RST 30H) is located.

The next 3 lines show the contents of the various Z80 registers. You can see here that
the A register now contains 42H (the B character) because we incremented it with the 
'INC A' instruction.

At this point, you can either press C to continue the program or ESC to return to the
Monitor/Debugger.

Let's try pressing C first.

Now you will see the following:
        B
        Breakpoint at PC=C012
        AF =439B  BC =5A5A  DE =C000  HL =0000  
        AF'=4D09  BC'=FFFF  DE'=FF03  HL'=4D09  
        IX =0018  IY =0000  IR =0040  SP =81FF  
        Press C to continue or ESC to return to Monitor

The first line is the program printing out the 42H value from the A register. This is
again followed by the breakpoint message, then the contents of the registers.

Now press ESC to return to the Monitor/Debugger. You will now see the Monitor prompt.

From the Monitor prompt, you can use the various commands we have already reviewed e.g. 
to look at or modify memory contents etc.

However, from the Monitor prompt, you can also press C. This command will continue the
test program from the last breakpoint!

Try it!

You will see:
        C
        Breakpoint at PC=C012
        AF =449B  BC =5A5A  DE =C000  HL =0000  
        AF'=4D09  BC'=FFFF  DE'=FF03  HL'=4D09  
        IX =0018  IY =0000  IR =0001  SP =81FF  
        Press C to continue or ESC to return to Monitor

Where the first line is the next character in the A register that is now being printed 
out.

Press ESC to return to the Monitor prompt.

From the Monitor prompt, you can press R to look at the contents of the registers.


Changing Register Contents

The Monitor/Debugger does not have a command to allow you to change breakpoint registers
directly. 

You will just need to modify the memory locations where the registers are 
stored when a breakpoint occurs. When the C command is executed, the Z80 registers are 
loaded from those memory locations.

The locations are the following:

Register        Address
A               8104H
BC              8106H
DE              8108H
HL              810AH
A'              810CH
BC'             810EH
DE'             8110H
HL'             8112H
IX              8114H
IY              8116H
SP              811AH
PC              811CH

You can use the E command to change the registers individually, then use the C command
to continue your program with the new register values.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The breakpoint handler code in the Monitor/Debugger will switch to the Monitor stack. If
your application works with data on the stack or use subroutines, you will want to use
your own stack space.

To do this, include the following line at the start of your program:
        LD      SP, 0FFFFH

This instruction will load the Z80 Stack Pointer with 0FFFFH which will place the top
of your stack space at the top of RAM memory.


I/O Ports

The I command allows you to read from an input port.

At the Monitor prompt, press I followed by the port address:
        I 80

You will see:
        i 80 02

The value 02H is what is read from the port 80H which is the 68B50 serial port controller
of the RC2014.

The O command allows you to write a byte to an output port.

At the Monitor prompt, press O followed by the port address and data you want to output:
        I 82 41

You will see:
        o 82 41A

Now where did that 'A' come from?

Well, you just wrote 'A' to the transmit port of the 68B50 serial port controller, which
sent it to your terminal emulator program, which then displayed it!

Try writing to port 82H values like 0DH (carriage return) or 0AH (linefeed)!


!NEW! Monitor/Debugger with BASIC

A new ROM image, monbas.rom, is available at the following URL:
https://github.com/ancientcomputing/rc2014/tree/master/rom

The monbas.rom image is a 16KB image that contains both the Monitor/Debugger and a 
slightly tweaked BASIC.

To use this, you will want to use Spencer's newest Pageable ROM Module board. Set it up
for 16KB starting at address 0000H.

By default, you will always boot to the Monitor/Debugger.

To invoke BASIC, use the "G" command for address 1000H:
        g 1000

To warm start BASIC, use the 1003H address instead:
        g 1003

To switch back to the Monitor, use the "monitor" keyword in BASIC. It will basically
restart the system.


Tips and Tricks

Returning to the Monitor

To return to the Monitor/Debugger from your program, you can jump to the Monitor
warm start entry point. 

To do this insert the following line to the end of your program:
        JP      153H

153H is the memory address (in hexadecimal) of the Monitor warm start routine.

If you want to capture the contents of the CPU registers at the end of your program,
just add a breakpoint to the end i.e. thr RST 30H instruction.


Resetting the RC2014

To reset the RC2014 from your program, just jump to memory location 0. Thus:
        JP      0H


Memory Map

The Monitor/Debugger uses RAM from 8000H to 81FFH.

Details of how this memory is used can be found in the source code.


Serial Terminal Emulator

I use a Mac for development along with an FTDI-based USB-to-serial cable. For the 
terminal emulator, I use a program called Serial. 

Serial gives you options to send files (either RAW or text) over to the RC2014.

In order to slow down the transfers so that the RC2014 does not drop characters, I set
up Serial for 1ms character delay. I also enable RTS/CTS flow control.
